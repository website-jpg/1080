 1080 is encountered by numerous different animals in forests, deer, birds, and sometimes domestic animals, like dogs, cats, and sheep. 
  The Department of Agriculture and Food Australia provides information on the effect on animals that 1080 has.
   ‘Canids (dogs and foxes) are among the most sensitive species to fluoroacetate. Herbivores and birds are less sensitive, 
   and reptiles and amphibians are relatively insensitive to 1080.’ 
   ‘Fish and other aquatic fauna (including many invertebrates) are relatively resistant to 1080, 
   and lethal concentrations would not be achieved even under intensive, operational baiting programs.’  
   - Department of Food and Agriculture Australia. <br> 
   <br> This source is reliable because it is published by the Australian Government, 
   which is a reputable source, and the report is written and peer reviewed by scientists. 
   This source claims that dogs are the most susceptible to 1080 poisoning, birds are less susceptible, 
   and reptiles are quite insensitive to 1080. This describes the effects of 1080 on common New Zealand species and the differences in susceptibility. 
   <br> <br> This information is reassuring, because as 1080 is used in wild, hard-to-reach places, it is very unlikely anyone will be walking their dog in these areas, 
   so despite dogs being susceptible to 1080, it is unlikely they will encounter it.  An Academic OUP article states:
    ‘A laboratory test has also shown that 1080 concentration up to 865 mg/kg soil produced no effects on soil invertebrates such as earthworms.’
     This source describes the effects of 1080 poisoning on invertebrates, implying they aren’t susceptible to it.
      This source is reputable as the reports were peer-reviewed and written by scientists with proper qualifications.
      These sources provide information on the effects of 1080 on common species of animals that may encounter it,
       which helps inform about by-kill from 1080 baits being used to kill pests. Dogs are susceptible to 1080, birds are mildly susceptible, 
       and reptiles are mostly insusceptible. This information would be helpful to dog owners, and because 1080 isn’t used near bushes people may walk their dogs, 
       it gives me reassurance that measures have been taken to minimize by-kill. They also explain the effects of 1080 on aquatic life, which is minimal, 
       which proves safety of the poison if it makes its way into bodies of water. Information on the effects of 1080 on deer is important to wild deer farmers, 
       as making sure they aren’t selling poisoned meat. The measures the NZ Government is taking to minimize by-kill, like using bird repellent, 
       proves to me commitment to protecting wildlife and minimizing harm to them, so they may enjoy the benefits of a pest-free habitat. 
       My opinion after reading these sources is that 1080 is relatively safe for non-target animals like reptile and fish species, 
       and therefore 1080 is ethical to be used in NZ. We have many endangered native reptiles in NZ, like the tuatara, 
       and so I find it reassuring that these creatures are resistant to 1080, and therefore are unlikely to die from the poison. <br> <br>
       This is important for conservation efforts, so I find it reassuring that these native animals can coexist with the poison, 
       and reap the benefits of not having pests like stoats and possums eat their eggs, giving the species a better chance of survival. 
       Dogs are susceptible to the poison, but the Government has taken steps to prevent dogs from being harmed, 
       by using 1080 only in hard-to-reach areas where it isn’t viable for any Department of Conservation workers to set possum traps, 
       let alone people to walk their dogs, and placing signs near the areas that 1080 is being used, 
       so that owners know to keep their dogs on a leash and watch their dogs to make sure they don’t run into any trouble. 
       These are all steps the Government has taken to protect dogs from 1080, so despite the fact they are vulnerable to it, 
       they shouldn’t be getting poisoned by it [1], and therefore I believe it’s ethical to use 1080 as its by-kill is minimized. 
       Birds are also susceptible to 1080, but the Government also took steps to protect birds from the poison, with the use of green dye on the baits, 
       which deter birds from eating them, because birds don’t particularly eat anything that is green. Cinnamon oil is also used to deter birds, 
       as they don’t like the smell [2]. These steps the Government has taken to deter birds from the 1080 baits increase my confidence in 1080 as an ethical pesticide, 
       as I am reassured that harm to birds has been reduced, and so birds can enjoy the benefits of a pest-free environment. 
       I also find it reassuring that deer repellent is used in baits, which deter deer from eating the baits, which means by-kill in the form of deer is reduced. 
       All these steps the Government has taken to minimize by-ill makes me more confident that 1080 is ethical to use, 
       as steps have been taken to reduce harm to non-target animals, and so they can be alive to enjoy the benefits of a pest-free habitat.
